# KNN-Diabetes-Classification
Machine learning project using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict diabetes based on medical diagnostic data

This project demonstrates the use of KNN algorithm to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. It's a personal portfolio project created to showcase fundamental skills in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python.

## The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
- Build a KNN classifier to predict diabetes presence.
- Evaluate the model using standard classification metrics.

## Dataset
**Source**: the dataset is derived from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database available on Kaggle.
**Features include:**
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (Target: 1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic)

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
